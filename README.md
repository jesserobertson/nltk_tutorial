# Introduction to text analysis in Python

Stolen from Iulia Cioroianu's publically available bundle, which you can get here: https://wakari.io/sharing/bundle/iuliacioroianu/Text_analysis_Python_NLTK

#### This tutorial provides: 

1. A very brief introduction to Python programming.
2. An introduction to natural language processing with NLTK. 
3. An example of a measure of text similarity. 
4. An example of supervised classification using NLTK. 
5. An example of clustering with NLTK. 

Examples based almost entirely on the NLTK manual: 
**Natural Language Processing with Python- Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit**
by Steven Bird, Ewan Klein and Edward Loper (free online: http://www.nltk.org/book/ )

#### Downloading the notebook

Before we begin, you need to **create a free account on www.wakari.io **

You can import this notebook directly into Wakari by clicking on the globe in the upper left corner (import from web) and entering the following URL: 

** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesserobertson/nltk_tutorial/master/nltk_tutorial_for_tib.ipynb **

You can also download the notebook and save it on your drive. 

#### How does the notebook work? 

The tutorial is running on a program called IPython, or "InteractivePython". The IPython Notebook runs in the browser. You won't need to install Python or any of the libraries and modules we will be working with today on your computer. Instead, we are using Wakari, a service that allows you to run IPython notebooks in the cloud.  

The notebook is separated by horizontal cells. Some of these cells contain text (instructions, extra information) and others are Python input fields, where you can write and execute code. 

- To navigate between cells you can click on the cell with your mouse, or use the up and down arrows on your keyboard. 
- If you double click on a text cell you can edit it (you can add your own notes, for example). 
- To write code in an input field simply click on the field and start typing. 
- To execute code in a cell click the "play" button in the tool bar above. The output will appear bellow the cell. You can also run the code in a cell by pressing Control-Shift-Enter on a PC or Command-Shift-Return on a Mac.

When we finish, you will be able to save all of your work to a Python script file and keep it for your records.
